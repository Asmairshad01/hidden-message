    <h2>For you,</h2>

    <p>
    sometimes when i look at the moon

    i like to imagine you are looking too,

    our gaze is a bridge from us to the sky

    and there's an invisible line that connects you and i,

    and even if i'm miles from you,

    after sunset,

    can we meet on the moon?
    </P>
